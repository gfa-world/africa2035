Intro Text:
In 1979 when K.P. Yohannan founded GFA World, he could only dream of the worldwide movement it would become with millions of believers worshiping the Lord across nearly 20 countries. Tens of thousands of Christian workers have been trained and share the love of Christ and hundreds of thousands of families have been lifted out of poverty. 
What we are doing throughout Asia we hope to do in Africa.

Rwanda Beginnings
In Kigali, Rwanda, a senior leader was able to find land, complete with buildings for an office and Bible college, at a fraction of the cost. Meanwhile, God moved on a supporter to provide the needed resources to purchase it. 
A team of missionaries began the work by ministering to the people in the community as well as helping 50 children through our child sponsorship program. Within just a few months, a church of 250 believers was established.
